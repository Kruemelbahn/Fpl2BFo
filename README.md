# Fpl2BFo

is a Windows program for reading FPL-files (created from [FPLEdit](https://fahrplan.manuelhu.de/)) and convert the file into a BFO-file (BFO = Station timetable) which can contain more than the timetable from FPL-file.
The program is compiled for x64-mode and works under Windows 11 and may work also on previous Windows-Versions (without guarantee).<br>

The program was created to the best of our knowledge and without guarantee of function in the hope that it will be useful.
If it is not useful - then it is not.

### Hint
If the program "Fpl2BFo.exe" cannot be started because MFC140.DLL is missing,
please use 'vc_redist.x64.exe' which is an installer for MFC140.DLL and can be downloaded from here (original link to Microsoft page):

https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe 

Execute the downloaded file for install.
